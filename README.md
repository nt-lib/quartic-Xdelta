# Quartic points on $X_\Delta(N)$

This github repository contains the code to reproduce the computations for the paper "Intermediate modular curves with infinitely many quartic points" by Maarten Derickx and Petar OrliÄ‡. 

The code here was tested using [Sagemath 10.2](https://www.sagemath.org/), [MDSage v0.1.0](https://github.com/koffie/mdsage/tree/v0.1.0) and [Magma V2.28-3](https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/).
